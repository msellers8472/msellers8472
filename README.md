- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @msellers8472, also known as Maggie Sellers! I'm currently working on my master's degree
in Data Science and Business Analytics from UNC Charlotte. I enjoy solving puzzles and programming
of all varieties. I am especially interested in the use of data science to help people. My UNCC student webpage, which contains some of my work in data visualization, is here: https://webpages.charlotte.edu/mselle14/ I can be 
reached at msellers8472@gmail.com.
